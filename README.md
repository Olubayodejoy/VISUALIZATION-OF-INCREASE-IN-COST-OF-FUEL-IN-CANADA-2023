The chart above illustrates the monthly petrol prices in Canada for the year 2023. It shows a fluctuating trend in prices throughout the year, highlighting key changes that may affect consumers and the economy.

Key Insights:
Price Increase: Starting from January, the prices show a gradual increase, reaching approximately 190 cents/litre in September. This rise may be attributed to various factors such as increased demand during the summer months and potential geopolitical influences on oil prices.

Price Peak: The highest recorded price occurred in September, suggesting that this month might be influenced by seasonal demand, including travel and tourism.

Subsequent Decline: Following September, the prices began to decrease, dropping below the levels seen at the beginning of the year. This decline could be due to factors like reduced demand as the summer travel season ended and adjustments in supply.
